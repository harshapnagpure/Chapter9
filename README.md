# Chapter9: File Handling

## 📌 Overview
In this chapter, I learned and practiced **File Handling in Python**.  
All concepts and practice are done by following the **CodeWithHarry YouTube channel**, and I used **VS Code** for writing and running the programs.

This chapter helped me understand how Python works with files to store, read, and update data.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- What is File Handling in Python
- Opening a file using `open()`
- Reading files using:
  - `read()`
  - `readline()`

  - `w` (write mode)
  - `a` (append mode)
- File modes:
  - `r` (read)
  - `w` (write)
  - `a` (append)
- Closing files using `close()`
- Using `with` statement for file handling
- Practical examples and small programs
